// The Polyhedron3 object represents a simple polyhedron.  The 'vertexPool'
// array can contain more points than needed to define the polyhedron, which
// allows the vertex pool to have multiple polyhedra associated with it.
// Thus, the programmer must ensure that the vertex pool persists as long as
// any Polyhedron3 objects exist that depend on the pool.  The number of
// polyhedron indices is 'numIndices' and must be 6 or larger  The 'indices'
// array refers to the points in 'vertexPool' that form the triangle faces,
// so 'numIndices' must be a multiple of 3.  The number of vertices is
// the number of unique elements in 'indices' and is determined during
// construction.  The programmer should ensure the polyhedron is simple.  The
// geometric queries are valid regardless of whether the polyhedron triangles
// are oriented clockwise or counterclockwise.
//
// NOTE:  Polyhedron3 is not derived from GeometricPrimitive, because the
// semantics of equal polyhedra is complicated and (at the moment) not useful.
// The vertex pools can be different and indices do not match, but the
// vertices they reference can match.  Even with a shared vertex pool, the
// indices can be permuted, leading to the same polyhedron abstractly but the
// data structures do not match.
