// The Polygon2 object represents a simple polygon:  No duplicate vertices,
// closed (each vertex is shared by exactly two edges), and no
// self-intersections at interior edge points.  The 'vertexPool' array can
// contain more points than needed to define the polygon, which allows the
// vertex pool to have multiple polygons associated with it.  Thus, the
// programmer must ensure that the vertex pool persists as long as any
// Polygon2 objects exist that depend on the pool.  The number of polygon
// vertices is 'numIndices' and must be 3 or larger.  The 'indices' array
// refers to the points in 'vertexPool' that are part of the polygon and must
// have 'numIndices' unique elements.  The edges of the polygon are pairs of
// indices into 'vertexPool',
//   edge[0] = (indices[0], indices[1])
//   :
//   edge[numIndices-2] = (indices[numIndices-2], indices[numIndices-1])
//   edge[numIndices-1] = (indices[numIndices-1], indices[0])
// The programmer should ensure the polygon is simple.  The geometric
// queries are valid regardless of whether the polygon is oriented clockwise
// or counterclockwise.
//
// NOTE:  Polygon2 is not derived from GeometricPrimitive, because the
// semantics of equal polygons is complicated and (at the moment) not useful.
// The vertex pools can be different and indices do not match, but the
// vertices they reference can match.  Even with a shared vertex pool, the
// indices can be "rotated", leading to the same polygon abstractly but the
// data structures do not match.
