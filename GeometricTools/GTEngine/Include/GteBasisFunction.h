    // Let n be the number of control points. Let d be the degree, where
    // 1 <= d <= n-1.  The number of knots is k = n + d + 1.  The knots are
    // t[i] for 0 <= i < k and must be nondecreasing, t[i] <= t[i+1], but a
    // knot value can be repeated.  Let s be the number of distinct knots.
    // Let the distinct knots be u[j] for 0 <= j < s, so u[j] < u[j+1] for
    // all j.  The set of u[j] is called a 'breakpoint sequence'.  Let
    // m[j] >= 1 be the multiplicity; that is, if t[i] is the first occurrence
    // of u[j], then t[i+r] = t[i] for 1 <= r < m[j].  The multiplicities have
    // the constraints m[0] <= d+1, m[s-1] <= d+1, and m[j] <= d for
    // 1 <= j <= s-2.  Also, k = sum_{j=0}^{s-1} m[j], which says the
    // multiplicities account for all k knots.
    //
    // Given a knot vector (t[0],...,t[n+d]), the domain of the corresponding
    // B-spline curve is the interval [t[d],t[n]].
    //
    // The corresponding B-spline or NURBS curve is characterized as follows.
    // See "Geometric Modeling with Splines: An Introduction" by Elaine Cohen,
    // Richard F. Riesenfeld, and Gershon Elber, AK Peters, 2001, Natick MA.
    // The curve is 'open' when m[0] = m[s-1] = d+1; otherwise, it is
    // 'floating'.  An open curve is uniform when the knots t[d] through
    // t[n+1] are equally spaced; that is, t[i+1] - t[i] are a common value
    // for d <= i <= n-1.  By implication, s = n-d-1 and m[j] = 1 for
    // 1 <= j <= s-2.  An open curve that does not satisfy these conditions
    // is said to be nonuniform.  The aforementioned book does not define
    // subclasses of 'floating' curves, but it is convenient to have a finer
    // classification.  Let us say that a floating curve is uniform when
    // m[j] = 1 for 0 <= j <= s-1 and t[i+1] - t[i] are a common value for
    // 0 <= i <= k-2; otherwise, the floating curve is nonuniform.
    //
    // A special case of a floating curve is a periodic curve.  The intent
    // is that the curve is closed, so the first and last control points
    // should be the same, which ensures C^{0} continuity.  Higher-order
    // continuity is obtained by repeating more control points.  If the
    // control points are P[0] through P[n-1], append the points P[0]
    // through P[d-1] to ensure C^{d-1} continuity.  Additionally the knots
    // must be chosen properly.  You may choose t[d] through t[n] as you
    // wish.  The other knots are defined by
    //   t[i] - t[i-1] = t[n-d+i] - t[n-d+i-1]
    //   t[n+i] - t[n+i-1] = t[d+i] - t[d+i-1]
    // for 1 <= i <= d.

    // Construction and destruction.  The determination that the curve is
    // open or floating is based on the multiplicities.  The 'uniform' input
    // is used to avoid misclassifications due to floating-point rounding
    // errors.  Specifically, the breakpoints might be equally spaced
    // (uniform) as real numbers, but the floating-point representations can
    // have rounding errors that cause the knot differences not to be exactly
    // the same constant.  A periodic curve can have uniform or nonuniform
    // knots.  This object makes copies of the input arrays.
